        <img src="../TAMID web pic.png" alt="data set picture" />
        <p>
          The data science branch of TAMID, traditionally a consulting and
          finance group working with Israeli companies, was started only a
          semester ago by my friend Barry Eom. I joined in as project manager
          the very first semester because I was very curious about how machine
          learning works and I thought exploring the field of data science might
          bring more ideas and opportunities for me since my first comp sci
          coding class in college has already allowed me to carry business or
          product ideas further. I designed the educational curriculum This
          semester, we are dividing into teams of 8 to work on hands-on 4 data
          science projects from VistaPrint(2), Whizar(1), and Tufts Financial
          Group(1).

        <p>
          JumboCode is a student-run group that develops software for non-profit
          organizations. I had volunteered at homeless shelters and food banks
          and had experienced some of the inconveniences of keeping track of
          supplies, so I was extremely happy to work for the Harvard Square
          Homeless Shelter team to make the process easier using technology. I
          focused on the admin website which allows admins to easily oversee
          supplies, volunteers, interactions with guests, and formal reports to
          the boss. I started with designing the sign in page using JSX, sign in
          users with Firebase. Then I designed a component that allows admin
          users to create admin users each with an email login and password. I
          changed to sign in rules so that only verified admin users can log in
          to the website and see supply data. My main challenge was to design
          the supplies page which shows 15 regular supplies along with supplies
          admins added for the day. The volunteers document each interaction
          with homeless guests on the mobile application and check the supplies
          they gave out to each guest. The website syncs with the app and
          displays the data for admins to make the end-of-day reports easier.
          This is the first time where my code is going to be used by real-life
          organizations. I learned to be extremely cautious about the functional
          correctness about my code and to be very deadline oriented. Our team
          communicated with the homeless shelter constantly to make sure they
          are aware of the design and delivered weekly presentations to the rest
          of JumboCode to update on our progress, which dramatically improved my
          communication skills.

        <h2>China Telecom Americas</h2>
        <p>
          I worked as a business operations intern during my freshman year
          summer at China Telecom Americas, a small company in Virginia focusing
          on cell phone plans for the Chinese community here in the US. This was
          not a very technical role, but it offered me a lot of operations,
          management, and leadership experience. I worked as a member of the
          technical customer support team in the beginning to learn about the
          company's daily business operations and to familiarize myself with a
          variety of products CTA offered. I realized there were some
          inefficiencies in training new customer support team members and
          communications between Chinese and American customer support teams so
          some tickets bounce between them without getting resolved. I started
          to write a curriculum to clarify the responsibilities of each team and
          the standard, improved procedure for handling different common issues.
          This curriculum became one of the essential guides for employees in
          the newly launched Canadian branch and aided the company to clear out
          customer support requests every day during the time of my internship.
          I also took on a side project of building a simple demonstration of
          using USPS API to detect incorrect addresses because I had noticed a
          lot of tickets reflect our customers filling out shipping addresses
          incorrectly because of the difference in address formats between the
          US and China and because I wanted to gain exposure in web programming.
          After I proposed the idea to my manager and showed her the demo, she
          forwarded the idea and the feature was eventually built by the
          engineering team in China.
