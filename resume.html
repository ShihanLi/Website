          <p>
            The data science branch of TAMID, traditionally a consulting and
            finance group working with Israeli companies, was started only a
            semester ago by my friend Barry Eom. I joined in as project manager
            the very first semester because I was very curious about how machine
            learning works and I thought exploring the field of data science
            might bring more ideas and opportunities for me since my first comp
            sci coding class in college has already allowed me to carry business
            or product ideas further. This semester, we are dividing into teams
            of 8 to work on hands-on 4 data science projects from VistaPrint(2),
            Whizar(1), and Tufts Financial Group(1).

          <summary>China Telecom Americas</summary>
          <p>
            I worked as a business operations intern during my freshman year
            summer at China Telecom Americas, a small company in Virginia
            focusing on cell phone plans for the Chinese community here in the
            US. This was not a very technical role, but it offered me a lot of
            operations, management, and leadership experience. I worked as a
            member of the technical customer support team in the beginning to
            learn about the company's daily business operations and to
            familiarize myself with a variety of products CTA offered. I
            realized there were some inefficiencies in training new customer
            support team members and communications between Chinese and American
            customer support teams so some tickets bounce between them without
            getting resolved. I started to write a curriculum to clarify the
            responsibilities of each team and the standard, improved procedure
            for handling different common issues. This curriculum became one of
            the essential guides for employees in the newly launched Canadian
            branch and aided the company to clear out customer support requests
            every day during the time of my internship. I also took on a side
            project of building a simple demonstration of using USPS API to
            detect incorrect addresses because I had noticed a lot of tickets
            reflect our customers filling out shipping addresses incorrectly
            because of the difference in address formats between the US and
            China and because I wanted to gain exposure in web programming.
            After I proposed the idea to my manager and showed her the demo, she
            forwarded the idea and the feature was eventually built by the
            engineering team in China.

          <p>
            JumboCode is a student-run group that develops software for
            non-profit organizations. I had volunteered at homeless shelters and
            food banks and had experienced some of the inconveniences of keeping
            track of supplies, so I was extremely happy to work for the Harvard
            Square Homeless Shelter team to make the process easier using
            technology. I focused on the admin website which allows admins to
            easily oversee supplies, volunteers, interactions with guests, and
            formal reports to the boss. I started with designing the sign in
            page using JSX, sign in users with Firebase. Then I designed a
            component that allows admin users to create admin users each with an
            email login and password. I changed to sign in rules so that only
            verified admin users can log in to the website and see supply data.
            My main challenge was to design the supplies page which shows 15
            regular supplies along with supplies admins added for the day. The
            volunteers document each interaction with homeless guests on the
            mobile application and check the supplies they gave out to each
            guest. The website syncs with the app and displays the data for
            admins to make the end-of-day reports easier. This is the first time
            where my code is going to be used by real-life organizations. I
            learned to be extremely cautious about the functional correctness
            about my code and to be very deadline oriented. Our team
            communicated with the homeless shelter constantly to make sure they
            are aware of the design and delivered weekly presentations to the
            rest of JumboCode to update on our progress, which dramatically
            improved my communication skills.

          <summary>Tufts Mail Project</summary>
          <p>
            When I started to notice more complaints from friends that they have
            to walk uphill for 20 minutes to get to the only mail service room
            on Tufts campus to then to stand in line for another 5 to 10 minutes
            to get their packages, I realized there is a challenge. It appeared
            that the current process of retrieving mail packages was
            inefficient. After consulting with several friends who had worked at
            mail services, I developed an app this summer that allows users to
            select an estimated time block during which they planned to go to
            mail services. The app then saves the data into Firebase, and
            calculates how many other people have registered for the same time
            interval. Based on those results, the app will suggest a better
            time, with a shorter waiting period, if the initial time slot
            selected time is filled with more than 20 people.
