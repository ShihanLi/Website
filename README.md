IMPLEMENTATION:

1. Did not meet html standard because button tag is inside a tag on 3 separate occasions.
2. Everything else has been implemented correctly.

HELP:

TA Michael helped me with using flexbox

HOURS:
I spent about 10 hours on this assignment. But mostly because I wasn't happy with my design and my implementation of flexbox, so I redid it.
