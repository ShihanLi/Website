        I focused on the admin website which allows admins to easily oversee
        supplies, volunteers, interactions with guests, and formal reports to
        the boss. I started with designing the sign in page using JSX, sign in
        users with Firebase. Then I designed a component that allows admin users
        to create admin users each with an email login and password. I changed
        to sign in rules so that only verified admin users can log in to the
        website and see supply data. My main challenge was to design the
        supplies page which shows 15 regular supplies along with supplies admins
        added for the day. The volunteers document each interaction with
        homeless guests on the mobile application and check the supplies they
        gave out to each guest. The website syncs with the app and displays the
        data for admins to make the end-of-day reports easier.
