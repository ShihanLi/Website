      <h3>
        I am double majoring in Computer Science and International Relations at Tufts University and I am looking for internships in software engineering this summer. I enjoy solving problems: I love how International Relations enables me to analyze things in a global, political/geopolitical perspectives, and how Comp Sci gives me the skills to make some of my ideas become reality. I was born and raised in Beijing. I moved to the United States during my junior year in high school and I speak both English and Chinese fluently.
