      <h3>
        I am a sophomore at Tufts double majoring in Computer Science and
        International Relations, with a minor in Economics. My family and I
        moved to Bethesda Maryland during my junior year in high school when my
        dad got a job at the Chinese Embassy in D.C. I have always come up with
        ideas frequently, no matter if its revolutionary in my opinion or just
        shower thoughts. (I remember telling the president of Thurgood Marshall
        College Fund that I wanted to sell packaged air of different scents from
        all over the world to developing countries with air pollution problems.
        He strongly approved.) But after attending the entrepreneurial
        internship at Gallup and the Clifton Foundation, I've really learned how
        to spot problems in real life and think about the opportunites for a
        great solution. I've realized the coding skills that I've gained in
        college has helped me tremendously in carrying my ideas further, so I
        decided to dig deeper in the field of computer science and understand
        the foundamentals of making a product on the technical level. In the
        long term, I want to gain a solid background in software engineering and
        product management before eventually starting my own company.
